The favicon.ico file is a binary file that typically contains an image. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create a favicon image using an image editing tool or an online favicon generator. Once you have the image, save it as "favicon.ico" in the specified directory.

If you need further assistance with creating the favicon or any other files, feel free to ask!
